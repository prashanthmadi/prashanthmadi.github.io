**Flask** is a micro web framework written in Python and based on the Werkzeug toolkit and Jinja2 template engine.

Below are list of steps we would follow

* Create Sample Project
* Create Azure WebApp and Use Site Extension to Upgrade Python
* Create and Change Deployment script
* Adding web.config (for production app with waitress)
* Publish App 

You can find a Sample Python Flask project with above operations @ [GitHub Link](https://github.com/prashanthmadi/azure-flask-httpplatformhandler)

####Create Sample Project in local environment
* Create `index.py` file with below content
```
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```
* Create `requirements.txt` file with below content
```
Flask==0.12
```
* Install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` file using below command.
```
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```
* Run app in local environment using below command
```
$ python index.py 
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
* Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ and you should see app up and running

####Create Azure WebApp and Use Site Extension to Upgrade Python

Navigate to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)

* Create a new web app
* [Setup Continuous Deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-web/app-service-continuous-deployment)
* Navigate to your App Service blade, select Extensions and then Add.
* From the list of extensions, scroll down until you spot the Python logos, then choose the version you need
![Site Extension](/content/images/2016/11/siteextensions.png)

For this blog I'm choosing `Python 2.7.12 x64`, It would install new version of python @ D:\home\Python27

If you choose `Python 3.5.2 x64`, It would install new version of python @ D:\home\Python35

####Create and Change Deployment script
I have explained more on how to utilize deployment script and what it does @ [link](/azure-custom-deployment). you can use this script to run commands on Azure App Services after moving code to it.

Install Azure Cli using below command

    npm install azure-cli -g
Use Below command to create deployment script. 

    azure site deploymentscript --python

Above step would create below two files

* .deployment
* deploy.cmd


<b>Note: If you haven't used nodejs/npm earlier, Create above files manually and copy content for these files from https://github.com/prashanthmadi/azure-flask-httpplatformhandler</b>

Replace content of deploy.cmd file with content at [Link](https://github.com/prashanthmadi/azure-flask-httpplatformhandler/blob/master/deploy.cmd)

We are changing default deployment script(removing virtual environment creation and others) and adding below content to install packages listed in requirements.txt

```
:: 2. Install packages
echo Pip install requirements.
D:\home\Python27\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
IF !ERRORLEVEL! NEQ 0 goto error
```

If you are using Python35 site extension change path from `D:\home\Python27\python.exe` to `D:\home\Python35\python.exe` in `deploy.sh`
```
D:\home\Python35\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```
####Adding web.config(Production Mode - Using Waitress)
[Waitress](http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/latest/) is meant to be a production-quality pure-Python WSGI server with very acceptable performance

Create `web.config` file with below content
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>
 <system.webServer>
  <handlers>
   <add name="httpPlatformHandler" path="*" verb="*" 
         modules="httpPlatformHandler" resourceType="Unspecified" />
  </handlers>

  <httpPlatform processPath="D:\home\Python27\python.exe"
 arguments="run_waitress_server.py" requestTimeout="00:04:00" startupTimeLimit="120" startupRetryCount="3" stdoutLogEnabled="true">
   <environmentVariables>
    <environmentVariable name="PYTHONPATH" value="D:\home\site\wwwroot" />
    <environmentVariable name="PORT" value="%HTTP_PLATFORM_PORT%" />
   </environmentVariables>
  </httpPlatform>
 </system.webServer>
</configuration>
```
If you observe carefully, we have 

* httpplatform arguments section to run `run_waitress_server.py` file
* Added new evnironmentVariable `PORT` to pass the internal port number we use in waitress

If you use Python35 site extension, change web.config content to use `D:\home\Python35\python.exe` for processPath
```
 <httpPlatform processPath="D:\home\Python35\python.exe"
 arguments="run_waitress_server.py" requestTimeout="00:04:00" startupTimeLimit="120" startupRetryCount="3" stdoutLogEnabled="true">
```

Add below line at the end in `requirements.txt` file. This would install waitress module during deployment
```
waitress==1.0.1
```

Create a new file `run_waitress_server.py` with below content
```
import os
from waitress import serve
from index import app

serve(app,host="0.0.0.0",port=os.environ["PORT"])
```

####Publish App 
Navigate to your root folder and commit your changes to `WEB_APP_GIT_URL`
```
git init  
git add .  
git commit -m "initial commit"  
git remote add sampleflaskapp WEB_APP_GIT_URL  
git push sampleflaskapp master  
```

Here is my App on Azure After publish
