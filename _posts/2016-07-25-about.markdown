My name is Prashanth Madi. I'm a programmer and Tech enthusiast. I work out of my office in Dallas,TX for the OpenSource Support Team at Microsoft, but this blog, its content and opinions are my own. I blog about technology, culture, gadgets, diversity, code, the web, where we're going and where we've been. I'm excited about community, social equity, media, entrepreneurship and above all, the open web.
