## Career Success :

* The New One Minute Manager [Link](https://www.amazon.com/New-One-Minute-Manager/dp/0062367544/) 
    * Helped me understand how to work with managers and set expectations up-front.
* Who Moved My cheese [Link](https://www.amazon.com/Moved-Cheese-Spencer-Johnson-M-D/dp/0743582853)
    * Nothing is constant and things would change all the time. This little book helped me understand how to manage changes at work.
* The Amazon Way: 14 Leadership Principles Behind the World's Most Disruptive Company [Link](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Way-Leadership-Principles-Disruptive/dp/1499296770/)
    * I would highly recommend this for anyone who is just getting started with career. Talks about work culture in Amazon and how they achieve high performance. I have already learn't most of these Principles with experience but reading earlier in career would have been more helpful.   


Recommended books that i haven't read yet..
* The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon [Link](https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Store-Jeff-Bezos-Amazon/dp/0316219282/)
