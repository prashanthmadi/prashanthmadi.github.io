Here are some Great Video's I came across in my life. I thought they are worth sharing and might help someone starting fresh. 

### General great advice on life:

* [The Last Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7zzQpvoYcQ), by Randy Pausch, its [Oprah Show Reprise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1CEhH5gnvg), and its [related media coverage](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/robins/Randy), 2007.
* [Time Management](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blaK_tB_KQA) by Randy Pausch and its [Powerpoint slides](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Randy_Time_Management_UVa_2007_slides.html), 2007.
* [The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M85UvH0TRPc)

### Computer Science
* [Paul Erdos - N is a number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRNGV85kPbI)
* [Claude Shannon - Father of the Information Age](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2Whj_nL-x8)
* [Alan Kay at OOPSLA 1997 - The computer revolution hasnt happened yet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKg1hTOQXoY)

### Courses I liked in [coursera.org](https://www.coursera.org/):

#### History 
* A History of the World since 1300
Probably the Best Course i took but its no longer available on Coursera

* [The Modern World, Part Two: Global History since 1910](https://www.coursera.org/learn/modern-world-2)
It may sound little boring in start but turns out to be good as we progress. Author provides an overview of both the world wars and their outcomes, Cold War situation and Modern world.

* [The Modern World, Part One: Global History from 1760 to 1910](https://www.coursera.org/learn/modern-world)
I haven't been through this yet but seems like good candidate for the list.
* [The Emergence of the Modern Middle East - Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/modern-middle-east-1)
This Course will discuss the emergence of the modern Middle East from the fall of the Ottoman Empire, at the end of the First World War to the present.

#### Programming
* [Functional Programming in Scala Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala)
Think this as a fresh air out of your day to day programming life. I was mesmerized by course content and it gave me new thinking of how i look at an issue.
* [Programming for Everybody](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python) (Getting Started with Python)
A good course for someone trying to learn python. Here is a better Python Tutorial from Google -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKTZoB2Vjuk
