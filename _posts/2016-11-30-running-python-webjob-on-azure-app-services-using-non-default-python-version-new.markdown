You can run programs or scripts in WebJobs in your Azure App Service web app in three ways: on demand, continuously, or on a schedule. There is no additional cost to use WebJobs.

This article shows how to run Python Webjob on Azure App Services using non-default python version. we would follow below list of steps to do this

* Create a sample app in local
* Create Azure WebApp and Use Site Extension to Upgrade Python
* Add run.cmd file to change default Python version
* Upload the app
* Install dependencies

##### Create a sample app in local
ex: **start.py**
```
import sys
print(sys.version)
```

##### Create Azure WebApp and Use Site Extension to Upgrade Python

* Navigate to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
* Create a new web app
* Navigate to your App Service blade, select Extensions and then Add.
* From the list of extensions, scroll down until you spot the Python logos, then choose the version you need

For this blog I'm choosing `Python 3.5.2 x64`, It would install new version of python @ D:\home\Python35

##### Add run.cmd file to change default Python version
To give little background,
We use the following logic to decide which file is the script to run within the job's directory:

* Per file type we look first for a file named:  run.{file type extension}  (for example  run.cmd  or  run.exe ).
* If it doesn't exists for all file types, we'll then look for the first file with a supported file type extension.
* The order of file types extension used is:  .cmd ,  .bat ,  .exe ,  .ps1 ,  .sh ,  .php ,  .py ,  .js .
* The recommended script file to have in your job directory is:  `run.cmd` .

In order for us to use custom python version instead of default python27, we add run.cmd file with below content in it
```
D:\home\Python35\python.exe start.py
```
you can use any other file instead of `start.py` and python version above as per your requirement.

##### Upload the app
* zip all your app content in local
* Navigate to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
* Navigate to your App Service blade, select WebJobs and then Add.

* After clicking Ok, you should see new webjob available to run
* Below is my webjob output, where i'm printing python version used to run it
