**Meteor** is a full-stack JavaScript platform for developing modern web and mobile applications. Meteor includes a key set of technologies for building connected-client reactive applications, a build tool, and a curated set of packages from the Nodejs and general JavaScript community.

This Blog would help you create a sample meteor app in local environment and later we would help you move sample app to Azure Web Apps 

#####Creating Sample Meteor App:

Use Below command to install meteor on local environment

    curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh

Check for your meteor version. we highly recommend using > 1.4

    meteor --version

Use Below command to create a sample meteor app

    meteor create simple-todos

Above command would create a new folder with few files for our sample app as in below screenshot

#####Using Demeteorizer to convert app into node.js format

Use below cmd to install Demeteorizer

    npm install -g demeteorizer

Navigate to your meteor app root folder and enter below cmd

    >demeteorizer

It would create a new .demeteorized folder

Navigate to .demeteorized/bundle/programs/server using below cmd

    cd .demeteorized/bundle/programs/server
Enter below cmd to install all the required node.js modules

    npm install

#####Running App on Local Env

Use below cmd to execute demeteorized/converted nodejs app in local environment

    PORT=8080 ROOT_URL=http://localhost:8080 npm start

#####Moving App to Azure

Create a new web app on azure and Setup continuous deployment and get the git url. Below link has details on it
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-nodejs-develop-deploy-mac/

Add below app setting to your web app inside Azure portal App Settings
Key : `ROOT_URL` 
Value : web app url(ex: `http://Your_APP_Name.azurewebsites.net/`) 

Create a web.config file @ .demeteorized/bundle/ and insert below link content
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/christopheranderson/azure-demeteorizer/master/resources/web.config

![web config file](/content/images/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-23-at-11-24-13-PM.png)


Navigate to .demeteorized/bundle/  folder and Commit your changes to `WEB_APP_GIT_URL`
```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git remote add samplemeteorapp WEB_APP_GIT_URL
git push samplemeteorapp master
```
