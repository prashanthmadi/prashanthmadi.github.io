I was working on a combination of scala with hadoop. After getting addicted to usage of eclipse IDE, It became too difficult to run the same job on command line. You can get the command you used in eclipse by following below simple steps. 

* Run a Program
* open debug perspective mode.
* wait till the job complete or terminate it
* In debug right click on <terminated : exit value 1> and select properties.
