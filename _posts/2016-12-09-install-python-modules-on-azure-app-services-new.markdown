Installing Python packages in Azure App Services is little tricky using pip. In this blog, I would provide best practice to do that. 

Pip Install on Azure App Services might fail because

* It may simply be that the package is not available on the Python Package Index. 
* It could be that a compiler is missing (Azure App Service is a sandbox environment and does not have all the modules/compilers installed inside it).

Below is one such common scenario
```
building 'Crypto.Random.OSRNG.winrandom' extension
warning: GMP or MPIR library not found; Not building Crypto.PublicKey._fastmath.
error: Microsoft Visual C++ 9.0 is required (Unable to find vcvarsall.bat). Get it from https://aka.ms/vcpython27
```
It's recommend to use [wheels](http://pythonwheels.com/) for installing Python dependencies. Many of the popular modules already provide wheel files listed in PyPI.

Let's say if I want to install below list of Python modules
```
django<2
pycrypto==2.6.1
pandas==0.18.1
numpy==1.11.1
```
####Creating Wheel Files in Local Environment
I'm using  `Python 3.5.2 x64` for this blog. So i will create wheel files for Python35 x64. 

*Note : You don't have to create wheels for all the Python modules. Do this only for modules which have trouble installing in Azure App Services*

* I have `python35 x64` installed in my local environment @ C:\Python35 folder
* Create a **requirements.txt** file and add above modules inside it.
* Install **wheel** module using below command (we would use this module to create wheels later)
```
> C:\Python35\python.exe -m pip install wheel
```
* Use Below Command to create wheel files inside wheelhouse folder in Local environment
```
> C:\Python35\python.exe -m pip wheel -r requirements.txt -w wheelhouse
```
Above step would have created a **wheelhouse** folder with wheel files for modules listed in requirements.txt file (In my cases it created wheel files for Python35 arch as you can see in file names)

* Alternatively, You can also Download wheel files available online @ http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

####Upgrade Python version on Web Apps
Default Python/Pip versions on Azure Web Apps are little old (as of 01/17 -This might change in future). Older version of Python/Pip have few known issues during deployment/run-time.

Follow Below steps to update Python version on your web app.

* Navigate to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
* Click on App Service blade of Web App, select Extensions and then Add.
* From the list of extensions, scroll down until you spot the Python logos, then choose the version you need

For this blog I'm choosing `Python 3.5.2 x64`, It would install new version of python @ D:\home\Python35


####Install requirements on Azure App Services
* While moving your code to Azure App services make sure to include below line of code as first line in requirements.txt file
```
--find-links wheelhouse
```
![find links in requirements.txt](/content/images/2016/12/webjob5.PNG)
##### Install Manually using Kudu
* Navigate to kudu console of your app (https://`Your_app_name`.scm.azurewebsites.net/DebugConsole) 
* Navigate to the folder where you have **requirements.txt** file and run bellow command
```
> D:\home\Python35\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```
* After running above command, all the Python modules listed in **requirements.txt** file would be installed @ `D:\home\Python35\Lib\` folder

You might have different path for python.exe depending on python version you are using.

##### Install using Deployment Script

If you are using Deployment script, Include below line of code in deploy.cmd
```
:: 2. Install packages
echo Pip install requirements.  
D:\home\Python35\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt  
IF !ERRORLEVEL! NEQ 0 goto error  
```

For more details refer [Django app with HttpPlatformHandler in Azure App Services - Windows](/django-app-with-httpplatformhandler-in-azure-app-services-windows/)

##### Install modules in non-default folder
As I have mentioned earlier, running above command would install modules 
@ `D:\home\Python35\Lib\` folder.

* Use -t option to install dependencies in non-default folder 
```
D:\home\Python35\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt -t D:\home\site\wwwroot\pymodules
```
Above Command would install Python modules @ `D:\home\site\wwwroot\pymodules` folder

* Set PYTHONPATH in App settings at Azure portal for web app

I have seen few wheel files/Python modules having trouble installing with older version of Pip/Python. Try with newer version's of Python/pip if you have any issues.
