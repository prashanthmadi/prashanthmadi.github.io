download arb software from the following link. 

choose the downloadable file based on your system os. 

http://download.arb-home.de/release/arb_5.2/ 

extract the download in a folder 

get into the folder and execute the file ./arb_install.sh 

after executing that it will ask some questions.. press enter and atlast it would give you options.. 1,2 or 3 

enter 1 for bash 

it would provide some path and paste that path in ./bashrc or profile files.. 

than go to the sh folder in /usr/arb 

there execute the arb_installubu..* file.. 

it should be given with parameter. if you execute without parameter it would provide some standard output error .. we can make that as base to provide parameters. 

after installing all of them depending on opengl or non opengl version.... 

enter arb.. 

the software would be started..
