My name is Prashanth Madi. I'm a programmer and Tech enthusiast. I work out of my office in Dallas,TX for the OpenSource Support Team at Microsoft, but this blog, its content and opinions are my own. I blog about technology, culture, gadgets, diversity, code, the web, where we're going and where we've been. I'm excited about community, social equity, media, entrepreneurship and above all, the open web.


## Books

#### Career Success :

* The New One Minute Manager [Link](https://www.amazon.com/New-One-Minute-Manager/dp/0062367544/) 
    * Helped me understand how to work with managers and set expectations up-front.
* Who Moved My cheese [Link](https://www.amazon.com/Moved-Cheese-Spencer-Johnson-M-D/dp/0743582853)
    * Nothing is constant and things would change all the time. This little book helped me understand how to manage changes at work.
* The Amazon Way: 14 Leadership Principles Behind the World's Most Disruptive Company [Link](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Way-Leadership-Principles-Disruptive/dp/1499296770/)
    * I would highly recommend this for anyone who is just getting started with career. Talks about work culture in Amazon and how they achieve high performance. I have already learn't most of these Principles with experience but reading earlier in career would have been more helpful.

### Courses I liked in [coursera.org](https://www.coursera.org/):

#### History 
* A History of the World since 1300
Probably the Best Course i took but its no longer available on Coursera

* [The Modern World, Part Two: Global History since 1910](https://www.coursera.org/learn/modern-world-2)
It may sound little boring in start but turns out to be good as we progress. Author provides an overview of both the world wars and their outcomes, Cold War situation and Modern world.

* [The Modern World, Part One: Global History from 1760 to 1910](https://www.coursera.org/learn/modern-world)
I haven't been through this yet but seems like good candidate for the list.
* [The Emergence of the Modern Middle East - Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/modern-middle-east-1)
This Course will discuss the emergence of the modern Middle East from the fall of the Ottoman Empire, at the end of the First World War to the present.

#### Programming
* [Functional Programming in Scala Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala)
Think this as a fresh air out of your day to day programming life. I was mesmerized by course content and it gave me new thinking of how i look at an issue.
* [Programming for Everybody](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python) (Getting Started with Python)
A good course for someone trying to learn python. Here is a better Python Tutorial from Google -  [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKTZoB2Vjuk)
